# Neural Network from Scratch (NumPy)

**Work in progress.**

This project is an implementation of a simple classification neural network built **from scratch using only NumPy**, without relying on high-level deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow.
The main goal of this project is **educational** : to better understand how a neural network works internally, with a particular focus on **backpropagation**, and how the model actually learns.
The network will be applied to a basic classification task on the MNIST dataset.

The experiments.ipynb notebook mainly contains the workflow, showing how I approach the problem step by step.
In parallel, I am working on implementing cleaner versions of the functions in separate .py files.
