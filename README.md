# Neural Network from Scratch (NumPy)

**Work in progress.**

This project is an implementation of a simple classification neural network built **from scratch using only NumPy**, without relying on high-level deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow.

The main goal of this project is **educational**: to better understand how a neural network works internally, with a particular focus on **backpropagation**, and how the model actually learns.

The network will be applied to a basic classification task on the MNIST dataset.
